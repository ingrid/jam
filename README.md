jam
===
A canvas / javascript game engine for rapid prototyping of 2d games.

**Use jam for:** Game jams, prototypes, brainstorming - any sort of rapid iteration on ideas. 

**Don't use jam for:** Any project that will take more than two weeks to finish.

Example games
-------------
The root directory has one example game, a pong clone. The code is commented pretty heavily.
Open pong.html on your browser to try it out, and view pong.js to see how it works.

Modules
-------
The engine is composed of modules, some of which are necessary core components, and the rest of which are optional.
Modules like Sprite, Sound, Input, etc. are always loaded in *jam*, and you don't have to do anything special to gain access to them.
More specialized modules like AnimatedSprite or Debug require you to specifically include them at the top of your game source.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is in progress. The engine code is commented, however, and each module includes usage examples.
